# PlanMyTrip App 

# Background
Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers love it too. And, as with any new product, they've recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data.

For this challenge, you will use the weather description data you've already retrieved in this module to enhance the PlanMyTrip app. Then, you'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta tester will choose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.

# Objective
This challenge consists of three technical analyses. You will submit the following deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data -For this deliverable, you'll generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data you gathered in this module, use your API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map -In this deliverable, you'll employ input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences. Next, you'll use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Finally, you'll show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map -For this deliverable, you'll use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, you'll create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
